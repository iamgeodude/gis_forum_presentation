This presentation is a general introduction to Cloud Native Geospatial,
so if you are already a regular user or provider of CNG data, you may find that your time
is spent in another presentation (dont worry, I won't be offended!). That said, in this presentation
will cover:

1. What is CNG?
2. Why would we want to adopt CNG data formats?
3. What are some ways we can use and access CNG?
4. What are some ways we can create CNG?
